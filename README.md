# Property-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict property prices using various machine learning models. The dataset has been preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting into training and testing sets (80-20). Several regression models were implemented to evaluate their performance.

# 📝 Dataset & Preprocessing
Missing values were handled appropriately.
Categorical variables were processed using One-Hot Encoding (OHE) and Label Encoding.
Data was split into 80% training and 20% testing.

# 📊 Results
Polynomial Regression showed the best performance with an R² score of 0.59.
KNN Regression had a moderate performance (R² = 0.20).
Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and Decision Tree did not perform well.
SVR Regression performed poorly (R² = -2.71).

# 🔍 Conclusion
Linear Regression was not effective for this dataset.
Polynomial Regression significantly improved performance.
Other models like Lasso, Ridge, and Decision Trees had limited predictive power.
Further feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning could enhance performance.

# 🔮 Future Improvements
Feature selection and engineering for better predictive accuracy.
Hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.
Experimenting with ensemble models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
Deploying the model using Flask or Streamlit for real-world use.
