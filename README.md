# Property-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict property prices using various machine learning models. The dataset has been preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting into training and testing sets (80-20). Several regression models were implemented to evaluate their performance.
